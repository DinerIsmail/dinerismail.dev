Once in a while someone asks me what resources I would recommend for learning web development, and how I keep up to date with things. Right now, we have access to more high quality learning material than we ever have, and most of it is even affordable. The bad news? Trying to find it can be like looking for a needle in the haystack of awful Udemy courses.

This post is my attempt at a list of vetted resources I recommend for high quality learning material that will be a good investment of your time.
