title: Delivery App for Community Kitchen
description: App used by volunteer riders who deliver food to those in need

This is a mobile-focused web app used so far by hundreds of volunteers who deliver food to people in Cambridge 3 times a week.

It's built with Next.js/React, Chakra UI, React Query and it's connected up to a Google spreadsheet that runs *lots* of scripts in the background (not written by me). The challenge here was handling the slowness of the Google Sheets API and making sure the app stays responsive throughout.
