title: Your Dev Setup is More Important Than You Think

At my previous job as a frontend engineer, we had a new developer called Jonathon who joined our team. He's very bright and eager, so he hit the ground running in no time. He started pushing tickets through with an incredible speed, and high quality code.

There's something else that he also did that I hugely appreciated and started doing ever since: whenever he was frustrated by something in our developer tooling and setup he just went and fixed it. Things like:

- fixed eslint misconfiguration that was meant we weren't warned about potential errors
- introduced Prettier which removed any arguments about formatting
- webpack configuration was improved and sped up builds
- improved folder structure to something a lot nicer to understand and use
- and so much moreâ€¦

Here's the thing - most developers simply don't pay much attention to the tools they use day-to-day. They just sit down, grab a ticket and get it done. Your engineering manager or product manager won't tell you to do it. He was the only person I met until then that put so much care into these things.

Within months, I saw a clear improvement in how quickly I can get things done, and even the sheer act of coding became more joyful. All of those little things that I previously had to decide or try to remember were automated away. Hundreds of times I was likely about to introduce a bug, but it was caught by ESLint before I even committed my code. This got me hooked. I took every opportunity to watch over his shoulder when he was playing around with improving our tooling, so I can learn as much as possible.

In my current team, I am what Jonathon was back then. Nothing escaped my questioning. Every time someone complained about something related to developer tooling, I fixed it (or at least tried to).

## Prettier

## ESLint

## Stylelint

## VS Code settings

## CI/CD pipeline

## What if you face opposition?
