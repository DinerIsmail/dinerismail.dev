This is a project I'm working on with a few other volunteers. Without any funding and only in our spare time, we managed to build something quite impressive.

The Resilience Web has a sleek list view of the groups, playful interactive web, as well as a dashboard which allows admins of the respective groups to manage their own listings on the platform.

It is built with Next.js/React, Chakra UI, React Query, a Prisma powered PostgreSQL database hosted on Digital Ocean and NextAuth for the authentication system. The backend is formed of serverless functions executed through Next.js API Routes.

I'm hoping to push this project much further in 2023, with a focus on getting more active users and feedback to help with shaping up the upcoming features.
