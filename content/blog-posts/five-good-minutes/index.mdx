I recently listened to a podcast with James Clear as a guest, where he was talking about building good habits. Something he said towards the end reminded me of how easy it can be sometimes to turn a mediocre day into a great one, in just a few minutes.

I sliced out the part I’m referring to, from the [How to Be a Better Human podcast](https://www.ted.com/talks/how_to_be_a_better_human_how_to_develop_the_habits_you_want_and_get_rid_of_the_ones_you_don_t_w_james_clear?subtitle=en):

I often have times when I start feeling unfocused and disorganised, to the point where I can barely get anything done. For me, this usually happens mid-afternoon. On days where I have a lot on my mind in particular and I’m stressed, this happens a lot more.

However, I found some great ways to break that and start feeling good again. The most effective one for me is a breathwork session - I use [the Wim Hof Method app](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/wim-hof-method-mobile-app), but I also like [this 3 minute one from Othership](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuHHlYL_DsQ). Other things include doing some pushups/pullups/air squats, spending 5 minutes in the garden or having a smoothie in the sun.

Sometimes, things are going wrong and you’re just having a bad day. But I think some bad days can be turned into good ones, maybe in just 5 good minutes.
